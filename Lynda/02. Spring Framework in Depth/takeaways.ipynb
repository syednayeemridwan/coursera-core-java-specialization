    "- Inversion of Control\n",
    "    - the container maintains all the classes including the dependency classes (framework is in control instead of developer)\n",
    "    - objects are inserted during runtime or startup\n",
    "    - Instead of finding the right class and pushing the dependeency, the object accepts the dependency during it's creation through constructor or setter\n",
    "        - Constructor injection : If the class cannot operate without dependency, it should be through constructor injection\n",
    "        - Setter injection : If the class can treat the dependency as optional or can accept multiple variable types of dependency, it should be through setter injection\n",
    "- Dependency Injection\n",
    "    - Classes should not instantiate their dependency or create new object\n",
    "    - Classes should only use the object that is given to them (Creating and using are two different things)\n",
    "    - There should be a separate injector class who will create object and then give the created object to the  class who needs that object.\n",
    "    - So the injector class will be responsible for passing or injecting a dependency.\n",
    "    - This is called dependency injection.\n",
    "    - three types:\n",
    "        1. constructor injection : Dependency is passed via constructor\n",
    "        2. setter injection : Dependency is passed via setter\n",
    "        3. method injection : Dependency is passed via method\n",
    "- Without dependency injection\n",
    "    - You want to contstruct main class\n",
    "    - Main needs dependency of Class A\n",
    "    - So you need to create object of class A and provide that to main\n",
    "    - Main needs dependency of Class B\n",
    "    - So you need to create object of class B and provide that to main\n",
    "    - Class B needs dependency of class X and class Y\n",
    "    - You need to create object of class X and object of class Y and provide them inside the object of class B\n",
    "    - You then need to give the constructed object of class B to class Main\n",
    "- With dependency injection\n",
    "    - You want to construct main\n",
    "    - IoC container manages all classes\n",
    "    - Main has dependencies\n",
    "    - Instead of constructing the objects, main only takes constructor arguments\n",
    "    - IoC container looks at the constructor arguments of Main and handles the construction of the dependency objects \n",
    "    - Framework is in control of the injection of these dependencies according to the needs"
