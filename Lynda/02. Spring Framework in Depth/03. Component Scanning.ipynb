    "    - For Spring, it can be with `@ComponentScan(basePackages = \"com.yourpackage.package\")` in ApplicationConfig.java\n",
    "    - Requires java or xml configuration for Spring\n",
    "    - Base package should be defined for component scanning\n",

    "- Helps to find the beans, services etc in the package\n",
    "- `@Component` : indicates that a class should be loaded in the bean factory\n",
    "- `@Service` : Stereotype of `@Component` that indicates that this class is a service\n",
    "- helps to scan base packages and the subpackages inside the base package \n",
    "- Loads configuration automatically for each bean it finds and helps IoC container to build the dependency graph\n",
    "- `@Autowired` helps the IoC container to inject the beans for dependency injection to the places where injection is required.\n",
    "- Best practices:\n",
    "    - Avoid using `@Autowired` on class attributes for testing purpose\n",
    "    - If dependency is required, use it on constructor\n",
    "    - If dependency is not required / optional , use it on setter\n",
    "- `@Qualifier` with a version name is used for injection if there are more than one beans of same type (NOT RECOMMENDED)\n",
    "- `@Value` is used to inject properties or constants. that property is not required in constructor if it is injected inside the specified class instead of configuration class"
