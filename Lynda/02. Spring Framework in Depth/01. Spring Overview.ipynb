    "- Dependency Injection\n",
    "    - Classes should not instantiate their dependency or create new object\n",
    "    - Classes should only use the object that is given to them (Creating and using are two different things)\n",
    "    - There should be a separate injector class who will create object and then give the created object to the  class who needs that object.\n",
    "    - So the injector class will be responsible for passing or injecting a dependency.\n",
    "    - This is called dependency injection.\n",
    "    - three types:\n",
    "        1. constructor injection : Dependency is passed via constructor\n",
    "        2. setter injection : Dependency is passed via setter\n",
    "        3. method injection : Dependency is passed via method\n",
    "- Inversion of Control\n",
    "    - the container maintains all the classes including the dependency classes\n",
    "    - objects are inserted during runtime or startup\n",
    "    - Instead of pushing the dependency, the object accepts the dependency during it's creation through constructor or setter\n",

    "    - Main has dependencies\n",
    "    - Instead of constructing the objects, main only takes constructor arguments\n",
